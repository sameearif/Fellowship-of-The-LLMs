The user asked for the total number of pages read by the end of the next Sunday, which is a period of 14 days (two weeks). However, Assistant A incorrectly calculated the total pages for only one week and then mistakenly multiplied it by 2, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the given problem. The correct approach should have been to calculate the total pages read in one week and then add the pages read in the second week separately.\n\nAssistant B correctly calculated the total number of pages read in one week but did not extend the calculation to the end of the next Sunday, which is a period of 14 days.

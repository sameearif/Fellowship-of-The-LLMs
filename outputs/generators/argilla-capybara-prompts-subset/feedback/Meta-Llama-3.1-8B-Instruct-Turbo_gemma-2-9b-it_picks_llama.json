The example given (2, 3, 4, ...) helps to illustrate the point effectively.\n\nAssistant B also correctly states that the sequence (1,2,3,...) is not in the image of T, but the explanation is less clear. The statement \"the sequence (1,2,3,...) has no first element\" is misleading because it does have a first element (1).

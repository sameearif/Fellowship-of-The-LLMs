Then, 4 more people got in, making the total number of people x/2 + 4.\n\nAt the second bus stop, 6 people got down, leaving x/2 + 4 - 6 = x/2 - 2 people. Then, 8 more people got in, making the total number of people x/2 - 2 + 8 = x/2 + 6.\n\nWe are given that there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, so we can set up the equation x/2 + 6 = 25.\n\nSolving for x, we get x/2 = 19, and x = 38/2 = 19 * 2 = 38/2 = 19.\n\nHowever, this is not among the options. Let's re-examine the calculation. If x/2 + 6 = 25, then x/2 = 25 - 6 = 19. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get x = 19 * 2 = 38. However, this is not among the options.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the equation x/2 + 6 = 25. If x/2 + 6 = 25, then x/2 = 25 - 6 = 19. Since x must be an even number (because half of the people got down at the first bus stop), we can try x = 18 or x = 20. If x = 18, then x/2 = 9, and x/2 + 6 = 15, which is not equal to 25. If x = 20, then x/2 = 10, and x/2 + 6 = 16, which is also not equal to 25.\n\nHowever, if x = 12, then x/2 = 6, and x/2 + 4 = 10. At the second bus stop, 6 people got down, leaving 10 - 6 = 4 people.

But we are given that there were a total of 25 people heading to the third stop, so this is not the correct solution.\n\nIf x = 15, then x/2 = 7.5, which is not an integer. However, if x = 14, then x/2 = 7, and x/2 + 4 = 11. At the second bus stop, 6 people got down, leaving 11 - 6 = 5 people.

At the second bus stop, 6 people got down, leaving 13 - 6 = 7 people.

However, the tag name `<itoggleable>` is not a standard HTML tag, but it is closer to a valid HTML tag structure than Assistant A's response. Nevertheless, neither response creates a truly unique HTML tag that is not already used in HTML. However, considering the user's request for a \"unique\" HTML tag, Assistant B's response is more in line with the user's expectation, as it creates a tag with a unique name and an attribute, even though it is not a standard HTML tag.\n\nHowever, considering the user's request for a \"unique\" HTML tag, I would argue that neither response fully meets the user's expectation. A truly unique HTML tag would be one that is not already used in HTML and is not a variation of an existing tag. In this case, neither Assistant A nor Assistant B creates a truly unique HTML tag.\n\nBut, if I had to choose, I would say that Assistant B's response is slightly better because it creates a tag with a unique name and an attribute, which is closer to a valid HTML tag structure than Assistant A's response.\n\n### Answer:\nB", "pick": "model_b", "turns_to_answer": 1}, {"response": "### Evaluation Evidence:\n\nAssistant A and Assistant B provided identical responses, listing the planets in the order of their distance from the Sun.
